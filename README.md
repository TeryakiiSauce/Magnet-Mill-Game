## Game Description
At the year 2179, scientists were finally able to create an object of a certain power through the use of magnets. The object is in the form of a cube. The scientists codenamed this "cube" to *"Little Limos".* Little Limos is a conscious object who has feelings just like humans. Little Limos's purpose is to serve humans in their daily needs. After mass production of this object of power, scientists began to sell them to various companies and industries. At present *(year: 2180)*, the food industry has the most demand on these "cubes", due to their ability at aiding in transporting ingredients and food in the best condition possible no matter what obstacles they face. Everyday, Little Limos begins its day by delivering food to customers happily. What do you think will happen after a while...?
